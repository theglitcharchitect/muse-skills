"""Count a BS report's own claims table and check the report's arithmetic.

Usage:
    uv run tally.py <report.md>          # print the correct tally + compliance check
    uv run tally.py <report.md> --fix    # rewrite the Tally line in place

Why this exists: across three real runs the tally was wrong every time — off by 2, then
by 8 — while the analysis itself was sound. Counting 47 table rows by eye is the kind of
work a model does badly and a script does perfectly. A fact-checking report whose own
arithmetic doesn't reconcile discredits every number above it, so this is not optional.

Exit codes: 0 all checks pass · 1 bad input · 2 report is non-compliant.

    """Write the run record's derived counts from the report, under `--fix` only.

    #44 was deferred on the grounds that a validator mutating its own oracle deserves
    its own decision, and the specific hazard named was `render_report.py` calling
    tally internally — an "attempts" counter would then count renders. Two things make
    this safe where that was not:

    - **Only derived, idempotent fields.** `extracted` and `checked` are recounted from
      the claims table, `dropped_ambiguous` is read off the Ambiguous line the report
      publishes, and `wall_seconds` is `finished − started`. Same inputs, same output,
      forever; re-running changes nothing. A counter of attempts is stateful and is
      exactly what this must not become.
    - **`--fix` only.** The renderer runs the gate without it (`render_report.py`
      invokes `[python, tally, report]`), so rendering can never reach this code.

    What it does *not* do: create a record, invent a field it cannot derive, or touch
    `started`, `finished`, `queries`, `tools`, `fetches`, `coverage_checks` or
    `unreachable` — everything the model alone can know stays the model's to write.

    Two real runs argued for this within an hour of the footer generator shipping: one
    reported 22 claims checked against a table of 20, and the mismatch was a typo in a
    number the script had already counted correctly for the tally line.
